Project Title ––> "Trail" - is a multiplayer bike game that is fun and engaging to play.

Project Description ––>

  Our project aims to make a multiplayer game, which allows atleast 2 and atmost 4 players to play simultaneously. It offers the user to experience playing a multiplayer game on a single PC. Unity game engine along with Visual Studio and blender have been used to make this game as it provides a good, user-friendly interface for beginners to implement their skills. This game is written in C#(C-Sharp) language. A very popular 3D animating and sculpting tool Blender was used to create the objects of this game. Each player creates a different color trail which mark their trajectory on the map(visible to all players).

Rules- Players keep eliminating as soon as they are hit either by their own trail or the one created by other players. Players can escape the trails by turning thier dukes either right or left using above commands. Last player standing emerges out as the winner.

How to use project:- Its UI includes some very basic buttons like in any other game:

  Play Button – To start the game.
  Audio Button – To mute and unmute music.
  Settings – Modify the current volume level. (looking forward to add more required options in Settings)
  Ideally, user would be given the choice to either play locally or by connecting multiple devices.

Local Game – 2 players - right/left and Q/E
3 players - right/left, Q/E and Z/C
4 players - right/left, Q/E, Z/C and I/P

Future Scope- There is a lot we would have loved to add to this game, but due to time constraints we couldn't.
  Some things we look forward to add are:

  Multiplayer online lobbies
  The feature of jumping during the game
  Custom designed bikes
  Multiple unique maps
  New game modes
  Better animations
